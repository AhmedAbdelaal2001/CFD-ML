This repository contains my solutions to tasks 2 and 3 of the qualifying assignment, in which I accomplished the following:
1. Implemented a solver for the Diffusion equation using the Finite Difference Method
2. Implemented an XGBoost model to predict Reynolds Stress Tensor discrepancies for Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modeling
